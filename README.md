## Hi there 👋 I’m Victoria Rivas Patrese 

🎓 I’m currently studying **(Computer Engineering)**.  
💻 My main programming languages are **Java** and **Python**—I'm always eager to learn more and expand my skill set.

## 🌟 About Me

One accomplishment I’m especially proud of is completing the International Baccalaureate program while also attending a selective Computer Science summer course at the University of Cambridge. I earned my place in that course through a scholarship I won in an academic essay competition.

Balancing a demanding academic program with an intensive technical course taught me valuable lessons in discipline, intellectual curiosity, and time management. That experience sparked my passion for technology and set me on the path I follow today.

Now, as a Computer Engineering student, I’m applying those foundational skills to practical projects—like building a log analysis pipeline to process server data and visualize key metrics, and developing projects involving automation, data analysis, and scripting.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Tower Defense Game** (in progress): My current personal project—stay tuned!
- **Log Analysis Pipeline**: Designed to process server data and visualize key metrics, enhancing monitoring and troubleshooting.
- More to come as I continue learning and building!
